The Code of Fed-MStacking: Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Stacking Misaligned Labels for Abnormal Heart Sound  Detection

## Abstract
Stuttering is a complicated language disorder. The most common  form of stuttering is developmental stuttering, which begins  in childhood. Early monitoring and intervention are essential  for the treatment of children with stuttering. Automatic  speech recognition technology has shown its great potential  for non-fluent disorder identification, whereas the previous  work has not considered the privacy of users  data. To  this end, we propose federated intelligent terminals for automatic  monitoring of stuttering speech in different contexts.  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed federated  intelligent terminals model can analyse symptoms of stammering  speech by taking the personal privacy protection into  account. Furthermore, the study has explored that the Shapley  value approach in the federated learning setting has comparable  performance to data-centralised learning.
